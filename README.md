# Overview
This repo was used a way to get some more experience with the ROS velodyne
drivers and ROS in general. The objectives highlighted below were originally
a part of a coding challenge. At the time, I did not have the skill set to
complete in the alotted 12 hours. I am now much more comfortable in the ROS
environment, and wanted to prove to myself that I complete the challenge with
ease.

Objectives
-----
Given the `.bag` file of recorded ROS topics, create three runnable ROS nodes
that do the following:

1. Remove 2 channels of signals from the 16 channels of the Velodyne VLP16
2. Remove noise in the remaining point cloud
3. Detect upright line structures in the point cloud and visualize them in
   colors.
